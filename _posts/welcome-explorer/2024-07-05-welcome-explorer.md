# Welcome to my blog!

<hr>

### Introduction:
<hr>
Ok so, I started a blog... I honestly don't know what I'm supposed to be doing, I am not sure about what exactly will be the content of my blog... or how often will I update it... or what I'm going to do with this page... but yeah, This is ***one*** step.  

I'm Adithya a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student in the department of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning... YES, ***AIML***... But I'm a kind of person who is interested in a lot of things, to begin with here's a list:  
- Cybersecurity [HackTheBox-Profile](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1997337)  
- Programming [Github](https://github.com/captainion2119)  
- Web Development 
- App Development 
- Photography [Insta-acc](http://instagram.com/voy_with_adi) (<- do give a follow)  
- Videography  
- Graphics Designing  
- Video Editing  

Ok that is a long list, but anyway, that is pretty much about me and what I do... I started this blog because I want something to hold me accountable for the things I learn and the things I make, I want to ensure that everything I do is documented, because:
1. I tend to forget things, so if I document them in a platform like a blog, I can remember all of it for a much longer time.
2. I consider that **Knowledge** should be **Free**. Hence what I learn will get on here, **FREE OF COST**.

Those are like the main <strong>Mission statements</strong> of this blog and I take the full responsibility to follow them to their last word.

```bash
cat Oath_main.txt

# I write this on the date of 06/07/2024 2:41AM I Adithyakarthik M will hold by
# my choices and commit to working on and maintaining this blog for how ever long
# that I can, I take a promise & Hold myself accountable to the choices I have made.

```

Ok ok, I think we became a bit too filmy about the entire thing... Let's get back the flow and talk about the more important topics of this blog...

For example...

what can one expect from the blog?
(P.S this is just brainstorming, and is subject to change.)
